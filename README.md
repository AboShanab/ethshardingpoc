# Ethereum Sharding Proof of Concept 

This repository contains a proof of concept for a sharding implementation on Ethereum by Vlad Zamfir. 
The project was built during [ETHBerlin](http://ethberlin.com/), over 2 days, and should *not* be considered final nor production grade.  

## Getting started [to be updated]

$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

## Known Issues
